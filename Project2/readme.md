**Project 2-1: UNIX Shell**

**Project 2-2: Linux Kernel Module for Task Information**

At the end of Chapter 3(P12-P22, textbook)

Two version of codes are provided for **Project 2-1**. The usage of quotation marks are supported in both version. The $\texttt{C}$  version is better designed and easier to understand but has a length limitation for every command, while the $\texttt{C++}$ version is more powerful that it can deal with commands with a infinite length.
